#  Project Overview 

As we move into summer, the need for in-home entertainment is at an all-time high. Families have gathered around the television (TV) for decades to enjoy movies or shows. With the introduction of companies like Netflix, entertainment has never been more accessible. Whether bonding over a love story or quivering with fear over a horror movie, Netflix continues to provide captivating streaming options. Our goal was to gather relevant data from Netflix movies and TV shows, transform it into a usable format, and load it into a database for analysis and reporting purposes. This dataset was chosen for its complexity and diversity, allowing us to showcase our ETL workflow skillset.

With that mindset for the project, we decided to design an ETL workflow to ingest data into the database, brainstorm to design some tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into an SQL database, and use pandas ERD code not covered in class to enhance our data engineering output, and  answer questions about the dataset. We decided on data modeling, engineering, and analysis facilitated through Jupyter Notebook, Pandas DataFrame, and Flask API. We included a method for reading data from the database and showed a display for future use.


# Purpose

Netflix is a streaming application that is very popular with all generations. Netflix allows users to access a very diverse selection of local and international movies and films. The objective of this project is to include data cleansing and organization, analysis, and engineering. We will import data from kaggle.com, design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, and import the CSV files into an SQL database. 


# Research
We performed intensive research for a new library that was not discussed in class. After several days of research, we decided to use the pandas_erd code to create an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) using a pandas DataFrame. The pandas_erd library is a powerful and specialized tool designed to simplify the process of visualizing the relationships within data stored in pandas DataFrames. It integrates seamlessly with pandas, leveraging its robust data manipulation capabilities to analyze and structure data relationships.
The code allows users to generate comprehensive ERDs by automatically detecting relationships between different DataFrame columns. It supports various types of relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many, providing a clear and accurate representation of data structures. This visualization is crucial for understanding complex datasets, identifying potential data integrity issues, and designing efficient database schemas.
By immersing ourselves in this project, we enhanced our skills in data collection, organization, analysis, and visualization. The use of pandas_erd specifically enabled us to better understand the underlying structures and connections within our data, which facilitated more informed decision-making and clearer communication of our findings. Additionally, working with this code introduced us to advanced features of pandas, deepening our proficiency in data science tools and techniques.

# Ethical Considerations and Instructions
There were two paramount ethical considerations for our project. The first ethical consideration was the source of our data. When obtaining data, privacy or consent (where people ask permission) are paramount. Our dataset was retrieved from Kaggle, a popular online platform and community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners. It provides a collaborative environment where users can find and share datasets, participate in competitions, and learn from one another. Using datasets from Kaggle offers several ethical benefits that ensure responsible data sourcing, utilization, and sharing. Kaggle provides transparent documentation about data origins and collection methods, which promotes informed and ethical use. Compliance with legal standards, such as data privacy laws, is enforced, protecting individuals' rights. The community review system allows for scrutiny and feedback, addressing potential ethical concerns like biases or inaccuracies. Kaggle promotes open science and collaboration, enhancing scientific integrity by allowing researchers to validate and reproduce findings. The platform's focus on educational opportunities aids in the ethical development of future data scientists. Moreover, Kaggle often supports projects with socially beneficial purposes, encouraging ethical applications of data science. Many datasets on Kaggle are curated for diversity and inclusion, helping to mitigate biases and ensure fair model performance across different populations. Additionally, data anonymization processes protect personal information, ensuring privacy. These factors collectively help ensure that data is used responsibly and ethically in various projects.

The second ethical consideration was referencing for data source(s) and any code that wasn’t ours. Proper attribution and referencing are fundamental to maintaining academic and professional integrity. By clearly acknowledging the sources of data and any borrowed code, we demonstrate respect for the original creators' intellectual property and contributions. This practice helps avoid plagiarism, ensuring that we give credit where it is due. Furthermore, accurate referencing provides transparency, allowing others to trace the origins of our data and understand the basis of our methodologies. It enhances the reproducibility of our work, as others can access the same sources and replicate our results, which is crucial for the scientific process. Additionally, it fosters a culture of openness and honesty within the research community, encouraging collaborative efforts and the sharing of knowledge. By adhering to proper referencing standards, we not only uphold ethical norms but also contribute to the overall credibility and reliability of our project. 

In summary, diligent referencing for data sources and external code is essential for ethical research practices, ensuring that the contributions of others are properly acknowledged and that our work can be trusted and verified by the wider community.
